# VHDL
A repo of VHDL projects as I learn VHDL.
---
##  Tools Used 
- **GHDL** : For compiling and simulating the VHDL code.
- **GTKWave** : For viewing the simulation waveforms.

--- 

- This repo includes the following basic VHDL 
- 1. Full Adder 
- 2. Ripple Carry Adder using Full Adder instance 
- 3. A basic m to N decoder
- 4. A control logic based Up Down Counter 
- 5. Shift Register - perfoming Right Shift which allows for parallel data load.
- 6. A Johnson Counter - allows to perfom both left and right shifts.
- 7. An N to 1 Mux 
- 8. A PWM(Pulse Width Modulation)
- 9. Clock Divider - generic : 16
